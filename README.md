YesWorkflow-MATLAB
==================

Overview
--------

The __yw-matlab__ module contains [YesWorkflow](https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-prototypes) (YW) modules and command line tools for interacting with the [DataONE MATLAB RunManager](https://github.com/DataONEorg/matlab-dataone/b). These tools make the RunManager's records of script runs and data provenance available to YW so that this retrospective provenance information can be queried in terms of, and in combination with, the prospective provenance revealed by YW annotations in the MATLAB scripts.

This repository also contains example MATLAB scripts marked up with YW annotations, the products of running YW on the scripts, and example prospective and retrospective queries of the provenance records jointly created by YW and the DataONE RunManager for runs of each script.
